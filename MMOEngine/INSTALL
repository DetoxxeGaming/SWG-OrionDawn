Pre-requisites
-----------------

  these are the recommended ways to obtain them
  
  note: under CYGWIN you have to run all these under one of the cygwin shells

  1. Mysql 5.0 or higher installed
     
        download the sources from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads

        and
	
        ./configure && make install

		note: on configure && make install if you want to run mysql server under windows
			  you still have to install the client connector library. to do so use the following
			  instead: 

        	./configure --without-server && make install

  2. Lua 5.1 or higher installed

        download latest source from http://www.lua.org/ftp/

        and

        make <PLATFORM> install

          notes: - to get a list of the platforms type 'make'
                 - on CYGWIN use 'generic'

  3. zlib 1.2.3

        download the sources from http://www.zlib.net/

	and

        ./configure && make install



Installing IDLC compiler
---------------------------

  - copy bin/idlc to /usr/local/bin or any other place where your system can locate it

  - add bin/idlc.jar to your CLASSPATH variable



Compiling Engine3
--------------------

  type 'make' to compile it from it's root directory

    
    notes: - on CYGWIN make sure <CYGWIN_PATH>\cygwin\bin is added to your local PATH
